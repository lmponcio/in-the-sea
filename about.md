Welcome to Alone in the Sea - a Blog in the making.

My name is Martin Poncio, I am a developer based in Sydney, Australia. My background is engineering and I am experienced automating tasks using Python. 

This blog is created in the spirit of helping people who want to learn to code. I learned programming by myself and I know it can be hard at times. Hopefully the content of this site is useful for you in some way.

In advance apologies: you might notice the site design is not fully finished - I've decided to start releasing posts as I move forward creating the blog. Hopefully documenting the process of building the site will be of use to someone else.

Thanks for reading!
