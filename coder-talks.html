To add in the future
  The articles in this section are intended to help you in your learning path from an angle different than a tutorial. Here you will find reflections related to how to build a portfolio, finding the correct next thing to learn, what role networking plays in our growth, and related topics
  The information provided in these talks is just my opinion. I'm just a human telling my experiences in the hope that someone else can find value in them - if I'm wrong in anything, apologies
