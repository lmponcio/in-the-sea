<p>The articles in this section are a journal of the changes applied to the website, including brainstormings about design ideas. From my angle I find documenting the work a healthy practice. I also think that someone else could benefit from taking a look at my process. </p>
<p>The articles in this section are not a tutorial. Posts here tend to be brief and to the point.
