This is the first official post of the website. Since every step of the way for creating the site is an investment of time I would like to share that process. Maybe, hopefully, it will be useful for someone.

The first step I am taking for defining the style of the site is creating a mood board - a visual brainstorming. I have used a [Canva template](https://www.canva.com/templates/EAFNpzGyfnE-cream-modern-aesthetic-feminine-tender-mood-board-photo-collage/) and images from Unsplash (links below mood board image). 

For the color palette I find it useful to grab a picture and extract colors from there. I have used a feature from [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) that generates a palette  when one color is given as an input. I will not use all of them, but it is a start.
