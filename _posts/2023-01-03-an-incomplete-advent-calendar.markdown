In December 2022 I participated in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) for the first time. Because of how life is in December I had time to only do seven days of it (my solutions are [here](https://github.com/lmponcio/advent-of-code-2022) - I used Python). Today I would like to share some thoughts about this kind of competitions. 

Normally I don’t spend time in coding exercises unless those exercises belong to a larger project that I am trying to build. So I have kept away from coding contests. My reasoning was “if I’m going to put hours towards a project, I want it to be something I will use in the future”. Today I feel a little different about it, and I want to share why.

In the few days that I participated I did not just solved the problems and moved on. Because of how the contest works I got curious about how other people approached the challenges so I checked solutions from friends, and solutions online - I even looked at solutions in other programming languages, just to see what people did. And I learned, and I had fun. After a few days I was wishing I had more time for participating in the event in real time.

I mention below a few aspects that I think make this type of event special:

### 24 hours between puzzles
Coding can be very lonely in the sense that when solving something, we often only look for help when getting stuck - [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is maybe a good example of a place where we all go to get unstuck. And after solving the problem we move on and don’t look back. We are always in a hurry looking at the big picture and trying to “get the project ready”.

After finishing an advent of code puzzle (if done in real time) there is no next problem to look at for 24 hours. And you also know that what you just solved was done by maybe other 20000 people on the same day. There is where the magic happens for me: being curious about what others did. Just plain childish curiosity that leads to learning. We get to review other’s approach to a problem we already know the solution to (or if not, even better), and we are surprised by the things we learn on the way. 

### Community feeling
I don’t know you, but I have spent a lot of time in the last few years watching self-paced tutorials in front of a computer. I have learned a lot from them, and I will watch many more for sure. But again, they have a lonely tone to them, no matter how cheery the youtuber and colourful the video.

Even the advent of code is not a course, it gave me a bit the feeling of a cohort of thousands of people. I watched preview videos about it from someone I follow, I messaged about it during the week with an ex housemate, and at work a special chat was created to share solutions. It was shared learning, in an activity that for me most of the time consists of myself in front of a computer with chill music and coffee. I think it’s a nice way of enjoying learning, by adding real people to live the process with - I think we need more of that.

### You can make it into a project
From my angle, sharing a [repository with your puzzle solutions](https://github.com/lmponcio/advent-of-code-2022) is a valid piece of portfolio - even if you only solved one. It is true that it doesn’t display all the skills recruiters might be looking for, but that’s why you will publish other projects that showcase those other skills. 

An advent of code solutions repository showcases problem solving and scripting ability. The skills required for solving the puzzles (even day one) are valid skills that many managers in companies are looking for - that’s why we see advertisements in the advent of code page.

## Conclusion
My first experience participating in a coding contest, the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com), has been very positive. After living this experience I would recommend anyone to give it a go to coding competitions (this one, or any other similar). It’s not about competing, but about joining a community and learning cooperatively. You can have fun, learn in the process, and get to meet interesting people.
